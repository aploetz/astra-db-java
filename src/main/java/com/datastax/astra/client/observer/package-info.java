/**
 * Provides the infrastructure for implementing an observable command execution mechanism within the application.
 * This package is designed around the Observer design pattern, enabling objects to subscribe and react to command execution events.
 * <p>
 * Central to this package is the {@link com.datastax.astra.client.observer.CommandObserver} interface, which defines the methods
 * that observers must implement to be notified of command execution events. Implementations of this interface can perform various actions
 * in response to these events, such as logging, auditing, or additional processing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This package allows for loose coupling between the command execution logic and the response handling logic. Commands can be executed
 * without needing to know the specifics of what will be done when they complete. This design facilitates the addition of new types of observers
 * without modifying the existing command execution or observer logic.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key components include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link com.datastax.astra.client.observer.CommandObserver} - The interface that all observers must implement.
 *     Observers are notified of command execution results through the methods defined in this interface.</li>
 *     <li>{@link com.datastax.astra.client.observer.LoggingCommandObserver} - A concrete implementation of the {@code CommandObserver}
 *     interface that logs command execution events. This observer serves as an example of how to implement custom behavior in response to command executions.</li>
 *     <!-- Add other implementations here as they are developed -->
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By facilitating an observable mechanism for command execution, this package provides a flexible and extensible approach to handling
 * command execution events in a decoupled manner. It enables the application to easily adapt to new requirements for monitoring,
 * logging, or otherwise responding to these events.
 * </p>
